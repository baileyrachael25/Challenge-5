# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is an application that allows the user to save tasks to timeblocks from 9am to 5pm. It is made with html, css, and javascript powered by jquery using the moment.js library to update the timeblocks depending on the current time of day.
The text entered in the timeblocks saves to local storage so that on refreshing the page the saved tasks will persist.
